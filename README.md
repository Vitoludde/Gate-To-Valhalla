# GTV
GTV (Gate To Valhalla) is a minecraft modpack. GTV started as a solo project for friends, but it turned out modpacking was fun, thus this modpack was born as a result of experimentation. GTV is a "multi-edged sword" meaning that the modpack includes something that everyone wants. Some just want to explore, some want tech and some want decoration. This modpack includes all of those things!
